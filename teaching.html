<center><h2><a href="https://catalog.williams.edu/PHIL/detail/?strm=1202&cn=14&crsid=021523"> Ethics of Technology (Instructor, Winter 2020)</a></h2></center>
<center><a>[Syllabus]</a><center>
<p><i>Course description</i>: A prominent company recently realized the machine-learning algorithm trained on its past hiring data had learned a bias against female candidates and so was unsuitable for resume evaluation. But given competing definitions of fairness, how should we decide what it means for an algorithm to be unbiased? Machine vision algorithms are systematically less likely to recognize faces of people of color. Since many face recognition algorithms are used for surveillance, would improving these algorithms promote justice? Deep fakes may pose serious challenges to democratic discourse, as faked videos of political leaders making incendiary statements cast doubt on the provenance of real videos. Do the researchers developing these algorithms, often academics funded by National Science Foundation grants, have an obligation to desist? In a field filled with such vexing questions, the ethical issue most commonly addressed by the media is whether a self-driving car should swerve to hit one person in order to avoid hitting two. In this class, we will go beyond the headlines to explore the ethics of technology. We will discuss issues such as transparency, bias and fairness, surveillance, automation and work, the politics of artifacts, the epistemology of deep fakes, and more. Our discussion will rely on articles from the course packet, enlivened by discussions with experts in the field over Skype. Students will apply their ethical knowledge to write multiple newspaper length op-eds arguing for their views. If students choose to submit these op-eds for publication, the instructor will coach them on appropriate procedures and venues.</p>

<center><h2>Problem Solving: How Science Works (Instructor, Spring 2019)</h2></center>
<a>[Syllabus]</a>
<p><i>Course Description</i>: A scientist announces that the sun contains a new, so far unknown chemical element, even though there is no hope of getting a sample. Another is sure that a famous predecessor has faked his data, even though he has seen nothing but the perfect, published results. Astonishingly, both claims prove to be sober and sound. We will explore the approaches and methods that make such miracles part of the routine of everyday science. This course is intended for students with little or no background in science.</p>

<center><h2>Magic, Medicine and Science (Instructor, Spring 2018)</h2></center>
<a>[Syllabus]</a>
<p><i>Course Description</i>: Science emerged from heady centuries in which inquiries into what we would now consider scientific topics â€“ including motion, the interaction of substances, medicine, nature, and the development of life -- were done by doctors, natural philosophers, magicians, and alchemists.  We will explore the intertwined traditions of science and alchemy within the period from 1550-1700 in Europe, often called the scientific revolution, as well as their roots in ancient and medieval. We will recast traditional narratives about the development of science by investigating their fuller context.  Our special focuses will be on the development of the concepts of sympathy and of force.</p>

<center><h2>Morality and Medicine (Instructor, Spring 2017)</h2></center>
<a>[Syllabus]</a>
<p><i>Course description</i>: All of us will be confronted at some point with difficult medical choices concerning our own lives, the lives of family members, or the lives of patients under our care.  This course is designed to help you meet such questions by providing a philosophical framework in which to judge the values you find most important and determine how they apply to specific biomedical contexts. In this course we will examine a number of ethical issues that arise in contemporary medical practice and research by analyzing articles and decision scenarios. Topics to be covered include the physician-patient relationship; informed consent; medical experimentation; termination of treatment; euthanasia; resource allocation; disability and well-being; race-based medicine; and health care reform.</p>

<p>Students who successfully complete this course will be able to identify and analyze different philosophical approaches to selected issues in medical ethics; will improve their reading and critical interpretation of arguments; and will develop skills that will enable them to think clearly about ethical questions as future health care providers, policy makers, citizens, and human beings.</p>
